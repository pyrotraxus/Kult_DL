<p> This project makes an improvement on Tom Laporta's original work. For more details on the original work, see: https://gitlab.com/fattom23/kult4e-foundry.</p>

<p> This version is not compatible with Foundry Vtt 8.6 - Do not update or you won't be able to delete moves, advantages .... </p>

<p>**0.8 Update: I have solved the problems of the original version and updated the whole visual of the sheet.</p>

<p> To add moves, advantages, disadvantages, etc..., just check your compendium and drag it to your sheet; then edit it.</p>

<p> This short version does not contains every description of these items because of copyright protections.</p>

<p> There are still many corrections to be made: for example the layout of text messages. This will be done gradually.</p>
